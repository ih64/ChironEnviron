# ChironEnviron
The [CHIRON Environment Web Page Repository](http://exoplanets.astro.yale.edu/environment). 
The site makes use of the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) framework, 
the plot is generated with [d3.js](http://d3js.org) connecting to the 
[chirondb](https://github.com/mattgiguere/chirondb) MySQL database via PHP, 
and a little bit of jQuery is used for interactivity. 

CHIRON is a fiber fed high resolution spectrometer located
on the 1.5 m telescope at the CTIO observatory in Chile.
